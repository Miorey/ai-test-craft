# AI Test Craft

## Automated Unit Test Generation for Python

AITestCraft is a Python package that assists developers in generating unit tests for their code. It leverages OpenAI's GPT models to create test cases based on the structure and requirements of your codebase.

### Features:

- Automated generation of unit tests from JSON configuration.
- Support for Python 3.10 and other versions.
- Allows for additional comments to guide test case creation.
- Sequential file processing for context-aware test generation.

### Prerequisites:

To use AITestCraft, you need an OpenAI API key. To obtain it, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an account at [OpenAI](https://openai.com).
2. Navigate to the API section and follow the instructions to generate your API key.

Before running AITestCraft, ensure that your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set with your OpenAI API key. Alternatively, you can specify a custom environment variable name for your OpenAI API key using the command-line interface.

### Installation:

Install AITestCraft using pip:

```bash
pip install aitestcraft
```

### Usage:

First, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or a custom one:

For Unix-based systems (Linux/Mac):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

For Windows:

```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Alternatively, use a custom environment variable:

```bash
export MY_ENV_VAR_NAME='your_api_key_here'
```

To generate unit tests, create a JSON configuration file named `to-test.json`:

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "language_version": "3.11",
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "overwrite": "never",
  "additional_comments": [
    "Use functions for each testcase and not unittest.TestCase"
  ],
  "files": [
    {
      "code": "aitestcraft/conf_representation.py",
      "test": "tests/test_conf_representation.py"
    },
    {
      "code": "aitestcraft/validators.py",
      "test": "tests/test_validators.py"
    },
    {
      "code": "aitestcraft/ai_generator.py",
      "test": "tests/test_ai_generator.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then run the package with:

```bash
aitestcraft to-test.json
```

Or if you're using a custom environment variable for the API key:

```bash
python aitestgen.py --open-ai-env-var MY_ENV_VAR_NAME ./to-test.json
```

### Configuration Fields:

- `language`: Programming language used.
- `language_version`: Version of the programming language.
- `model`: OpenAI [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/continuous-model-upgrades) used for generating tests.
- `overwrite`: [`"neve"` / `"always"`] If set to "never", existing test files will not be overwritten.
- `additional_comments`: Optional, global comments for test generation.
- `files`: A list of objects representing the source code and the test files.

In the `files`, if a comment starts with `AI-TEST`, it indicates a message for the AI to include specific demands for the next line, like so:

```python
# AI-TEST: don't test this condition
```

### Note:

The generated tests may require minor adjustments to fit the exact needs of your project.

Order the files in `to-test.json` from the most standalone files to those with the most dependencies. This helps to provide context that can improve the quality of the generated tests.

### Disclaimer:

The test generation is not guaranteed to be perfect and might need adjustments to work seamlessly with your codebase.
